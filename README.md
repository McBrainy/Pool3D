# Pool3D
3D zero-gravity pool using Java3D.

This is a 3D zero-gravity pool game that I developed initially as a final
project for a Computational Geometry class using a [simple rendering
engine](https://github.com/CSUDallas/Geometry2014) that our class created. This
changed in [this
commit](https://github.com/McBrainy/Pool3D/commit/52c39a775719225524d4cbf515d199f9576e92b2),
when I switched to Java3D. While the important work of math, physics, and
graphics is done, the game still needs the addition of pockets and simple game
mechanics to be fully playable. (At present, it is more of a physics
simulation.)
